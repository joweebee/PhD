# PhD
Code developed during my PhD project, referred to in my thesis.

This thesis follows the characterisation of the cellular response to a range of electrospun polymer blend scaffolds designed as a dual-action antimicrobial and osteoinductive tissue engineered solution, through to the development and optimisation of a novel chick foetal femur model utilising micro- Computed Tomography to analyse the affect that such scaffolds have on bone healing.

The chapters contain:
- Chapter 1: Introduction
- Chapter 2: Literature Review
- [Chapter 3: Materials Production and Initial Screening](https://github.com/joweebee/PhD/tree/main/Chapter_3)
- [Chapter 4: Improving Mechanical Stability - Cell Response to Crosslinked Scaffolds](https://github.com/joweebee/PhD/tree/main/Chapter_4)
- [Chapter 5: Determining the Efficacy of a Novel Ex-Vivo Model for Bone Healing](https://github.com/joweebee/PhD/tree/main/Chapter_5)
