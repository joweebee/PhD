# PhD
Code developed during my PhD project, referred to in my thesis.

This thesis follows the characterisation of the cellular response to a range of electrospun polymer blend scaffolds designed as a dual-action antimicrobial and osteoinductive tissue engineered solution, through to the development and optimisation of a novel chick foetal femur model utilising micro- Computed Tomography to analyse the affect that such scaffolds have on bone healing.

The chapters contain:
- Chapter 1: Introduction
- Chapter 2: Literature Review
- Chapter 3: Scaffold Production and Initial Screening
