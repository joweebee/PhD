## 7.4.3.	 Methodology: Surface degradation studies of silane-modified PCL films

Directly following the silanisation process detailed in section 7.4.2, 0h timepoint baseline water contact angle readings were taken using the following process. Remaining cover slips were transferred to 6-well plates and submerged in basal medium. These were incubated at 37 Â°C supplemented with 5 % CO2 for up to 7 days.

At appropriate timepoints (1 h, 6 h, 24 h, 3 days, 7 days), water contact angle measurements were carried out using the sessile drop method, on an Attension Theta Lite Optical Tensiometer (TL100, Attension, Biolin Scientific, Finland). Three technical repeats were used for each measurement, with 10 replicate measurements taken across the surface of 2 cover slips (5 measurements from each). Infra-red images of the droplets were recorded at 15 fps for 10 s and analysed using One-Attension software.

Exported data was processed using MATLAB r2019a ([WCA.m](https://github.com/joweebee/PhD/tree/main/Appendices/WCA.m)).
