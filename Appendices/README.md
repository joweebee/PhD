## Appendix 3: 7.3.	Presentation of CTAn Workflow Automation Programming 
[femurs20-60-220.ctt](https://github.com/joweebee/PhD/tree/main/Appendices/femurs20-60-220.ctt) was programmed as a task list in the Custom Processing toolbox of CTAn. It produces a histogram which can be related to the densities of the material at each voxel scanned, then applies some noise reduction in an optimised manner, followed by CPU intensive 3D analysis, which produces the numerical data presented in this document. Stages 3, 4 and 5 are repeated, with the dataset reloaded between repeats so that both the lower density (cartilaginous) and higher density (mineralised tissue) readings can be taken. 

## Appendix 4: 7.4.3.	 Methodology: Surface degradation studies of silane-modified PCL films

At appropriate timepoints water contact angle measurements were carried out using the sessile drop method.
Exported data was processed using MATLAB r2019a ([WCA.m](https://github.com/joweebee/PhD/tree/main/Appendices/WCA.m)).
